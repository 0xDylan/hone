# hone
âœ¨: the original batch version of honectrl without all of the restrictions!

---

as we all probably know, the newer versions of honectrl are very restricting against the amount of free tweaks

that each user can use. this 'older' batch version of the program still works like a charm and has absolutely no

restraints or restrictions! please enjoy tweaking!
